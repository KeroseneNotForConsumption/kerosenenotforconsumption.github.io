# A Repository For Questions on Chemistry (mostly)

The primary purpose of this blog is to answer some of the unanswered questions on chemistry that I had while learning chemistry - in high school and in college. 

Some of those questions cannot be answered without delving deeper into chemistry, as well as other disiplines such as physics and math. Such questions will be answered in the simplest way possible.

These questions will seem easy at the surface, but when dug deeper, they reveal important insights into chemistry. I hope that you not only learn some chemistry, but also share some of the epiphany that I had when understanding chemistry - the feeling that motivated me to start this blog.

# Modeling and Simulating Chemical Phenomena

The other purpose of this blog is to share some of my attempts of modelling and simulating chemistry with code, mainly python.

This blog will focus on explaining the general workings of my projects, which will most likely be available as a public [Github](https://github.com/KeroseneNotForConsumption) repository.
