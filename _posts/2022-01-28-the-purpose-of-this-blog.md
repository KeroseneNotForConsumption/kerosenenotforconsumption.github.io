# A Repository For All Unanswered Questions

The primary purpose of this blog is to answer some of the unanswered questions on chemistry that I had while learning chemistry - in high school and in college. 

Some of those questions cannot be answered without delving deeper into chemistry and other disiplines such as physics and math. Such questions will be answered in the most simple way possible.

Other questions may seem easy at the surface, but when dug deeper, reveals important insights into chemistry. I intend to introduce and address such questions as well.

# Modeling and Simulating Chemical Phenomena

The other purpose of this blog is to share some of my attempts of modelling and simulating chemistry with code, mainly python.

This blog will focus on explaining the general workings of my projects, which will most likely be available as a public [Github](https://github.com/KeroseneNotForConsumption) repository.
