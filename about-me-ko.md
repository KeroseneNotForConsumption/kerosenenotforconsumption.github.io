# Chemistry Major

저는 현재 물리 화학 및 컴퓨터 화학에 관심이 있는 화학 전공입니다.

저는 고등학교 때 화학에 처음 관심을 갖게 되었습니다. 그곳에서 일반적인 고등학교 화학에서 유기 화학과 같은 대학 수준의 재료에 이르기까지 많은 것을 배웠습니다. 그 과정에서 받은 질문은 저로 하여금 이 블로그를 시작하고 그 질문에 답하도록 동기를 부여했습니다.

# Programming as a Hobby

I am also an aspiring pythonista, with various ongoing, complete, and (sadly) abandoned projects.

So far, I have some experience with the following modules:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- SimPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- and more to come!

My first attempt at applying programming to chemsitry was when I and a group of friends built an ideal gas simuation with the Unity game engine. Since its inception, I added more features to it, such as intermolecular forces (according to the Lennard-Jones potential), and bonding/dissociation (which follow second-order and first-order kinetics). I was especially proud of the latter as the simulation could now demonstrate dynamic equilibrium. I may revisit this in the future.

# Kerosene Certainly Not For Consumption

My username, "KeroseneNotForConsumption", was chosen just because (A) it was distinct and memorable (B) I liked it. You can call me *Kerosene* if you want.

If you have accidently ingested kerosene, do not attempt to vomit as aspirating kerosene can cause serious damage to the lungs.  Seek medical attention immediately, and certainly do not smoke cigarettes like this [Darwin Awards recipient](https://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2012-03.html).
