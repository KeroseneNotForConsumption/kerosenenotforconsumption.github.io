# Chemistry Major

I am a chemistry major currently interested in physical chemistry and computational chemistry. 

I first became interested in chemistry in high school, where I learned a lot - from your typical high school chemistry to college level courses such as organic chemistry. The questions I had from those courses motivated me to start this blog and answer those questions. 

# Programming as a Hobby

I also am an aspiring pythonista, with various ongoing, complete, and (sadly) abandoned projects.

So far, I have some experience with the following modules:

- NumPy
- SciPy
- SimPy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly
- and more to come!

My first attempt at applying programming to chemsitry was when I and a group of friends created an ideal gas simuation with the  Unity game engine. After its inception, I added more and more features to it, such as intermolecular forces (according to the Lennard-Jones potential), and bonding/dissociation (which follow second-order and first-order kinetics). I was especially proud of the latter as the simulation could now demonstrate dynamic equilibrium. I plan to revisit this in the future.

# Kerosene Certainly Not For Consumption

My username, "KeroseneNotForConsumption", was chosen just because (A) it was distinct and memorable (B) I liked it. You can call me *Kerosene* if you want.

If you have accidently ingested kerosene, do not attempt to vomit as aspirating kerosene can cause serious damage to the lungs.  Seek medical attention immediately, and certainly do not smoke cigarettes like this [Darwin Awards recipient](https://darwinawards.com/darwin/darwin2012-03.html).
