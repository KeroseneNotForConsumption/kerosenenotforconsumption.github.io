  <p>Hello, my name is Shinyoung Park.</p>
</div>


I am a [chemistry major](https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/) 
at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) 
and an undergraduate researcher in the [Intelligent Chemistry Lab with Professor Woo Youn Kim](https://wooyoun.kaist.ac.kr/).

<!-- I am a recipient of the [KFAS Traning Program for Overseas PhD Scholarship](https://eng.kfas.or.kr/theme/kfaschanel/intl_scholarship_5.php) and expect to graduate in February 2026 with a GPA of 4.27/4.30. -->

My research interests include:
- Physical, computational, and AI/ML chemistry
- Their applications across various areas of chemistry and materials science

### More about my research

My interest in physical chemistry began with a challenge to find the origins of the σ-π description of double bonds, which led to a deeper appreciation for chemistry as the art of simplifying complex problems. 

This led me to advanced coursework and research, where I contributed to developing computational tools such as ACE-Reaction for predicting reaction mechanisms, AutoCG for generating conformations and exploring transition states, and MetalloGen for automated 3D conformer generation of organometallic compounds.

### More about my background

My experience of attending an international school in New Delhi, forming lasting friendships with exchange students in high school, and serving as head of the Internationalization Team in the Department of Chemistry Student Council at KAIST has taught me the value of building bridges across cultures. 

From sharing snacks to supporting international classmates in the lab, I have learned that inclusion begins with small acts and intentions. I hope to carry this spirit forward and help create strong, supportive communities wherever I go.
