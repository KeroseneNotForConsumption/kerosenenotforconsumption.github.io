### Hello! My name is Shinyoung Park! 

I am currently a [chemistry major](https://chem.kaist.ac.kr/) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) and an undergraduate researcher in the [Intelligent Chemistry Lab with Professor Woo Youn Kim](https://wooyoun.kaist.ac.kr/).

I am interested in <span id="shuffle-text">physical chemistry.</span><script src="/js/text_shuffle.js"></script>

While I enjoy working hard researching the topics above, I also enjoy learning and sharing interesting tidbits about chemistry, which was the initial motivation behind this website!
