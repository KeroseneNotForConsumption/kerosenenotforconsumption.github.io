My deep dive into chemistry began with a challenge posed by Professor Insung S. Choi during a *Physical Organic Chemistry* lecture. While discussing the bent bond model of double bonds, he offered an A+ to the first student who could find the earliest mention of the σ-π description of double bonds, where σ bonds are described by valence bond theory and π bonds are described by molecular orbital theory. To my dismay, someone else had already found a review article that credits a 1934 paper by W. G. Penney[^1] before the end of the lecture.

Later that day, curious whether Penney's work was truly the first, I carefully read through the paper and, to my surprise, found that it did not actually contain the σ-π description as we know it today. Eager to have another shot at the A+, I stayed up late digging through literature from that era. By morning, after an extensive search, I concluded that early discussions on the aromaticity of benzene, such as Hückel's landmark paper in 1931[^2] or Pauling's 1933 paper[^3], were more appropriate. I presented my findings to the class and finally earned the A+.

While exploring 1930s quantum theories, I came to see that much of chemistry is about distilling complex problems down to their essence, resulting in simple yet useful models. With this newfound appreciation for chemistry, I delved deeper, taking graduate-level courses such as *Quantum Chemistry I, Statistical Mechanics I, Organic Synthesis I, and Organometallic Chemistry*.

During this time, I was working in Professor Woo Youn Kim’s lab[^5], extending the capabilities of ACE-Reaction, a graph-theoretic method for predicting reaction mechanisms.[^6] I designed an autoregressive message passing neural network to suggest plausible reaction steps. I also adapted a mathematical formulation of an existing metric that originally applied only to balanced reactions to also handle unbalanced reactions. In addition, I integrated automatic transition state (TS) search routines into ACE-Reaction using both semi-empirical and density functional theory methods.

As part of this ongoing effort to expand ACE-Reaction, I also worked on AutoCG, which would completely transform my understanding of chemistry. AutoCG is an algorithm for generating reactant and product conformations for use in interpolation TS search methods.[^7] Its innovation lies in constructing a pseudo-TS structure that qualitatively resembles the true TS. The pseudo-TS is then gradually modified to produce reactant and product structures that are naturally well-aligned, in a manner similar to intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations.

However, early iterations failed to yield the desired reactants or products in certain cases, such as the exo product in a Diels-Alder reaction. By analyzing common features among these failures, I concluded that controlling the R/S configuration at the reaction centers of the pseudo-TS structures would lead to the desired stereochemical configurations in the reactants and products.

Implementing this solution was challenging because RDKit struggled to generate pseudo-TS structures with the correct stereochemistry. Drawing on my experience with molecular modeling kits and force field optimizations in Avogadro, I proposed a workaround: physically twisting two substituents of a stereogenic center to invert its R/S configuration, while continuously optimizing the overall structure using a force field. This approach allowed us to generate all relevant stereoisomers of a pseudo-TS from a single conformer.

Our updated algorithm generated reactant and product conformations that successfully led to the desired TS structures, allowing us to finalize and publish our paper in the *Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation*.[^7] However, what intrigued me most, even more than the publication itself, were the unexpected TS structures that emerged from stereoisomer enumeration. Analyzing TS structures from pathways such as frontside S<sub>N</sub>2 attacks and antarafacial-antarafacial Diels-Alder reactions led me to realize that chemistry, especially its most novel and interesting aspects, extends beyond simplified models.

My current project, MetalloGen, lies at the heart of this effort to move beyond simple templates and constructs. MetalloGen is a fully automated 3D conformer generation utility for organometallic compounds.[^8] Unlike its predecessors, it supports a wide range of polydentate and polyhapto ligands, expanding the scope of organometallic compounds accessible to automated computational methods. Drawing on my experience with computational chemistry programs from my work on AutoCG, and my deep understanding of d-orbital chemistry during the *Organometallic Chemistry* course, I proposed key ideas behind several core features of MetalloGen. These included introducing dummy atoms between polyhapto ligands and the metal center to enable 3D conformer embedding with RDKit, and refining embedded structures using both force field and quantum chemical methods.

I also led the literature review that guided development, curated datasets and catalytic systems to benchmark MetalloGen, and conducted tests and analyses that improved the tool's reliability. As a result, MetalloGen can now automatically generate major classes of organometallic complexes important in catalysis, including metallocenes and half-sandwich structures, which were previously unavailable through fully automated methods. This work, currently submitted, reflects my broader goal: to develop automated computational tools that not only predict established chemistry but also uncover new discoveries in domains that are often overlooked.

My journey so far has taught me how to transform curiosity into tools and methods that open new directions in molecular and materials science. From building algorithms like AutoCG and MetalloGen to designing machine learning components for ACE-Reaction, I have prepared myself to pursue research that connects physical principles with data-driven approaches. I am especially eager to develop interpretable AI models grounded in chemical theory, generate synthetic datasets through computational chemistry, and create generative models for materials discovery.

Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to lead a research group in academia or industry that advances chemistry and materials science through both computational and machine learning methods. I look forward to the day when my work can spark in others the same sense of curiosity I felt while poring over those early quantum chemistry papers, opening the way to discoveries we cannot yet imagine.
