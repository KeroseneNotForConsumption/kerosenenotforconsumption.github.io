# The Blog

The primary purpose of this blog is to share some of my questions and answers on chemistry.

In this blog, I will also showcase some of my attempts at modeling and simulating chemical phenomena with code.

# Any more questions?

If you have any questions or suggestions about anything about this blog, feel free to email me. I may not be able to respond to all emails in a timely manner, but any input will be appreciated greatly.
